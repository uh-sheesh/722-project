<p>Campus organizations (those run by the institution, students, and the community) have many official and unofficial ways to recruit and advertise events, communities, academic opportunities. But recruitment is just one part of the overall student experience; organizations must then both deliver and engage the students, but also retain participation. For many potential college students and their parents, campus engagement is an important consideration toward the value of education at the institution. Does the campus have sports teams and run intermural sports events? Are there student support organizations? How is Greek Life on campus? These are just a few examples of what potential members of the community may be concerned with.</p>
<p>So how do campus organizations recruit, engage, and by proxy, retain students through their activities and events? This project explores two commonly used media that allow for the bridging of organizer and participant at George Mason University (GMU). The first medium is an official platform designated by GMU to “Discover Events, Meet Patriots, Get Involved, and Access Resources.” The second medium is Twitter, a commonly used social media platform that, although unofficial and unregulated, is widely accepted by students, faculty, and the community in general.
This project is split into 2 sections aimed at different audiences. If you:

<h3>A Smart and Connected City Perspective</h3>
<p> Developing a smart city requires collaboration among different institutions and facilities like educational institutions, transportation, etc. A part of smart city project can be transferring a university into smart or digital campus. Smart campus refers to using advanced network infrastructure and internet-connected devices to provide supportive and engaging experiences. It joins people, devices, and applications and allows universities to make insight-driven decisions to improve security and maximize resources. (Majdi, Unknown) For example, smart campus has smart students, smart classroom, smart mobility, etc.</p>

<p>Smart campus provides many advantages to the society. First, it provides a sense of safety. Second, it cultivates a digitally connected experience. It also elevates the communication and awareness among the students and facilities. In order to transferer a university into smart campus, the university must relay in using technology and increasing interactivity among its community. For instance, GMU can be considered a semi smart campus because they implement and use high technology and services. However, with the online classes, the interaction among the students has been decreased.</p>
